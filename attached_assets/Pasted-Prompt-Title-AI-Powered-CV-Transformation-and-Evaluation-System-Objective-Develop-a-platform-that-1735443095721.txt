Prompt Title: AI-Powered CV Transformation and Evaluation System
Objective: Develop a platform that uses AI to transform a user-uploaded CV to align with a new job role/title based on a job description provided in a message box. Additionally, the platform will:
1.	Identify problems the target organization might be facing using web searches (e.g., Glassdoor, Indeed, articles, YouTube).
2.	Score the updated CV against industry standards.
3.	Provide actionable feedback on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
4.	Offer the option to fully generate a new CV tailored to the job description.
The website will be monetized with a subscription model (£5 monthly), include secure user registration, and an admin section for management.

Implementation Suggestions
1.	Backend: Use Python with Flask/Django for the CV processing and user management logic.
2.	Frontend: React.js or Next.js for dynamic UI interactions.
3.	AI Integration:
o	Replit or OpenAI or Anthropic APIs for CV rewriting and scoring.
o	Replit for hosting and debugging collaborative development.
4.	Web Scraping: Use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Puppeteer for gathering organization-related problems.
5.	Database: Use PostgreSQL for secure storage of user data and transformed CVs.
6.	Security:
o	Implement HTTPS.
o	Encrypt passwords with bcrypt.
o	Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication (e.g., Google sign-in).
Monetization & Scalability
•	Payment Integration: Stripe for handling subscriptions.
•	Scalable Hosting: AWS or Replit for deployment.
This system can revolutionize the CV tailoring process, providing users with insights into target organizations while ensuring their applications are industry-ready.
