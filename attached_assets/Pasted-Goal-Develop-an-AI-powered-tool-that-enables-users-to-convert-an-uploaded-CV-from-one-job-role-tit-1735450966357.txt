Goal:
Develop an AI-powered tool that enables users to convert an uploaded CV from one job role/title to another. The tool should:
1.	Focus on the latest employment entry in the CV, adjusting it to align with a new role specified by the user.
2.	Tailor the CV to address challenges and requirements detailed in a job description supplied via a text box.
3.	Enhance the CV using relevant and recent information about the target organization’s challenges gathered from Glassdoor reviews, Indeed reviews, articles, and YouTube videos.
4.	Evaluate the revised CV against industry standards, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and offering actionable advice for improvement.
5.	Provide an option to fully regenerate the CV for the targeted role, ensuring consistency in start and end dates across all employment entries.
