Step 1: Backup and Review Existing Codebase
Create a backup of the existing project to prevent data loss.
Identify the key components handling:
User registration and verification
CV conversion logic (Ensure it's not affected)
Email sending (Contact form, feedback, reset password, etc.)
Payment processing for Standard and Pro Plans
Features available for Pro Plan users
Step 2: Implement the Payment Flow for New Standard Plan Users (£5)
Modify the email verification page to include a Stripe payment form for £5 after email verification.

Locate the existing verification logic and add a payment section to it.
Ensure the verification process only marks a user as "verified" once they complete payment.
Use Stripe Price ID: price_1QsdBjIPzZXVDbyymTKeUnsC
Update the database to record users as Standard Plan after successful payment.
Update user authentication logic:

Ensure users who haven't paid cannot proceed past the verification page.
Users who complete payment should be redirected to the CV conversion page.
Step 3: Improve the Pro Plan Upgrade System
Allow existing Standard Plan users (£5) to upgrade to Pro Plan (£15) by paying an additional £10.

Modify the payment link to check if the user is on Standard Plan.
If so, adjust the payment amount dynamically to £10 instead of £15.
After successful payment, mark them as Pro Plan users.
Ensure Pro Plan users get access to exclusive features:

Locate where Pro Plan features are defined (AI Agent for scanning interviewers and organisations).
Verify that only Pro Plan users see these features after logging in.
Step 4: Allow Pro Plan Users to Downgrade to Standard Plan (£5)
Add a downgrade feature where Pro Plan users can reduce their subscription back to £5.
Modify Stripe subscription settings to allow this.
Ensure the system marks them back as Standard Plan after processing.
Prevent users from using Pro Plan features once downgraded.
Step 5: Handle Existing Free Users
Ensure users who signed up before this change can continue using the free plan but only for 30 days.
Implement a check that calculates 30 days from their registration date.
Once expired, prompt them to pay £5 to continue as a Standard Plan user.
Redirect expired users to the payment page.
Step 6: Testing & Deployment
Test the following scenarios before deploying:

New users: Registration → Email verification → £5 payment → Login → Access Standard Plan features.
Standard Plan users: Upgrade to Pro Plan (£10 extra) → Get Pro Plan features → Logout/Login → Verify Pro features persist.
Pro Plan users: Downgrade to Standard Plan (£5) → Ensure Pro features disappear.
Free users (signed up before this change): Continue for 30 days → After 30 days, check if they are forced to pay £5.
Ensure email sending, CV conversion, and other critical logic remain unaffected.
